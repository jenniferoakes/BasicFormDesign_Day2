This assignment serves to reinforce HTML forms and relevant tags

Learning Objectives

Our goal with this assignment is to get practice with HTML forms. By the end you
should be familiar with various form elements (most of them) and how data is
transmitted once a form is submitted.

Your Mission

You must duplicate the form from this animated image:

force_signup.gif
Certain fields are required:
name, email, origin story, application date, and password
The number of objects that one can levitate cannot go below zero
The "Start Over" button should revert all fields to their default state
Use proper semantic fields

Use Request Bin to inspect the submitted form data, and make sure you're
sending everything necessary to the server

Go to Request Bin
Create a RequestBin and copy the link (something like: http://requestb.in/1bhrpsc1)
Add method and action attributes to your form so that the data is POSTed to
the request bin
Submit the form (you'll be taken to a page that says "ok")
Refresh the Request Bin page with "?inspect" at the end
(for example: http://requestb.in/1bhrpsc1?inspect)
Profit!
How to Submit
You should have two files: your HTML and your CSS.

Create a NEW repository on GitHub
Clone that repository to your local machine
Be sure to commit FREQUENTLY - I want to see MANY commits on a REGULAR basis
When you're done (or at regular intervals), make sure you pushed your commits
to GitHub
Finally, submit your GitHub repository URL to the assignment here on newline
AN EXTRA BIT

Additionally, you could deploy your site on Github pages, and add a README.md
file to the repo which contains a link to the Github pages site.

EPIC Mode
Change the color of the input borders when the input is focused
(when the cursor is in it)
Change the color of the input background when the input is invalid
You must deploy this project to GitHub Pages for live viewing
